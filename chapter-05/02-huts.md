title: Huts with odd symbols
---

There are those huts with odd symbols.

# Hint
And each hut (and thus, a symbol) has a button somewhere near them.

# Hint
There must be an order in which to push the buttons.

# Hint
Look around. Go down the tunnel that gets you near the water.

# Hint
There is a column with one of the symbols (the hands).

# Hint
Look around the column. Look at the symbols to mark them in the diary.

# Hint
Push the buttons near the huts in the symbol order from bottom to top.
