The door opens by pulling _both_ levers. The right one is missing the top.

# Hint
Look around for a piece of info where to find the top.

# Hint
There is a small locker on top of the crate, right from the door.

# Hint
In the box you find a note showing where the top is.

# Hint
Look closely the picture. There's flowers.

# Hint
Go back a bit. There you find the area with the flower offering and the loose flower.
