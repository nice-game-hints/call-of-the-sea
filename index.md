Call of the Sea is an adventure video game played from a first-person perspective. The game is set in the 1930s, and players assume control of Norah, who must explore an island set in the Southern Pacific to find her husband, Harry, who has gone missing after embarking on an expedition.

The puzzles are quite linear. The hints here are even more gradual than usual and contain more pictures.
