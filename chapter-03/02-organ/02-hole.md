There is a large round hole in front of the organ. It should be in correct position for the organ to work.

# Hint
The four positions reminds of the *moon phases*.

# Hint
It should be in the correct position for this day.

# Hint
But you can't see the moon. You have to find that information somewhere else.

# Hint
Look around in the camp.

# Hint
There is a calendar on the wall next to the projector. Look at that. Nora will write the moon phases into the journal.

# Hint
Try to find out what the current date is.

# Hint
Nora keeps a *journal*, doesn't she.

# Hint
Read the current date from the Log. ^[ It is November 7th, 1934. ]

# Spoiler
According to the calendar it is new moon today. Put the hole totally shut.
