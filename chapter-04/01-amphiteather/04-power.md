# Hint
You will find the turbine near the waterfall. [Move the waterfall.](03-waterfall.md)

# Hint
The wheel is now moving. [Connect the wheel to the generator.](05-wheel.md)

You have to enable all the buttons to get maximum power. It is a game where the neighbour button toggles.

Pull both levers down.

# Hint
Find the other levers:
 - First in the hut
 - Second one on top of the "tower" near the hut.
 - Third one at the amphiteather
