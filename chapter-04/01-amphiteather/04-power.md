title: Getting power to the amphiteather
---

The sound system around the amphiteather would need some power.

# Hint
Follow the cords.

# Hint
You will find the turbine near the waterfall. [Move the waterfall.](03-waterfall.md)

# Hint
The wheel is now moving. [Connect the wheel to the generator.](05-wheel.md)

# Hint
You have to enable all the buttons to get maximum power. It is a game where the neighbour button toggles two other neighbours. You just have to play it.

# Hint
After you get all buttons enabled pull both levers down in the tent.

## Spoiler
Find the other levers:
 - First in the hut
 - Second one on top of the "tower" near the hut.
 - Third one at the amphiteather
